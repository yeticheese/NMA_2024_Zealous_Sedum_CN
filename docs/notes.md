### Recordings
- Visual stimuli and the 
- fluorescence of the neurons is recorded using the 2-photon microscope. 
- running speed of the mouse is recorded, 
- position and area of the pupil.

### Questions to explore
There are many ways to explore these datasets, so these are not exhaustive by any means.

- Compare single cell visual responses across different types of cells (defined by Cre lines) and different areas.

- Look a population coding. Each imaging session includes a population of neurons. This ranges from roughly a dozen neurons for inhibitory Interneurons to up to 400 neurons for denser excitatory neurons. Can you decode the stimulus from population activity? What is the structure of correlations between neurons in different populations?

- Compare responses to different types of stimuli. How well can you predict responses to naturalistic stimuli from the responses to artificial stimuli, or vice-versa? Do the correlation structures differ based on the stimulus that is used?

- Explore neural activity (single cell or population) in relation to behavioral variables such as running speed or pupil area/position. Do these differ across areas/Cre lines?

- Explore behavioral variables (running speed/duration or pupil area/position) by themselves. Do different transgenic lines exhibit different behaviors?
